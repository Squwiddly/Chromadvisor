    "## 1. Find functional groups function\n",
    "The goal of the **<font color=\"blue\">find_functional_groups</font>** function is to take the smiles of  the molecule to analyze as input and draw out the different functional groups of the molecule, as well as the number of times it is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we wrote a function capable to detect the functional groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had to put the **<font color=\"green\">output if the input is incorrect</font>**  : \"Error : Impossible to convert the SMILES into a molecule.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We then had to choose a **<font color=\"green\">database for the functional groups</font>** that can be detected. For each functional groups in the database found, we decided whether we wanted to keep them so they could be detected. We deleted those we found too complicated and those we didn’t see in our organic course.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we ran the function, we saw that the function **<font color=\"red\">detected too many functional groups</font>**. For example in the case of acetic acid, the function detected a carboxylic acid but also a hydroxyl and a ketone. In reality, this molecule only possess a carboxylic acid functional group, in fact composed of a ketone and hydroxyl but they should not be in the output of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remedy this, we had to put an **<font color=\"green\">if statement</font>** such as : if there’s an carboxylic acid, there should not be a ketone and a hydroxyl. But some molecules possess a carboxylic acid AND a hydroxyl, or a ketone, such as salicylic acid. By just excluding the possibility of hydroxyl and ketone in the presence of carboxylic acid, the hydroxyl present would not be detected. We thus decided to use an if statement saying that once a functional group has been detected, its smiles is deleted from the smiles total of the molecule. Once it has been detected and deleted, the analysis of the functional groups continues, without detecting many times one specific functional groups. The list of functional groups used for the detection, also had to be modified for the function to work correctly : the **<font color=\"green\">groups had to be detected by order of “importance”</font>**. This means the functional groups with the “highest number of functional group in it” must be first in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to count the **<font color=\"green\">number of appearances of the functional group</font>** we used their positions. In order to **<font color=\"green\">detect the positions</font>**, the function detect the functional group and give all correspondence possible of the motif. Each correspondence returned is a tuple of atom indices. These tuples are stored in a dictionary under the key “position”. To count the number of times the functional is present, we then needed to count the number of tuples of atom indices. This number is stored in the dictionary under the key “count”.\n",
